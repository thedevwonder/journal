    title: Self Learning
    draft: true

This is something I am probably going to end up coming back to a lot. A compilation of different perspectives on learning and a loop of self learning process.

The world seen from the lenses of a problem solver would be full of problems. These complex systems that somehow manage to function well even without being perfect tells us something. The real world is not perfect and so theoretically when we map the world or create simulations of it, we try to make it perfect. It is our pursuit to keep solving, making things better or different.

We model the world trying to understand it, communicate it and in turn perfect it. These models, are our knowledge base for everything out there in the world, be it medicine, space, internet or people's behaviors. A number of people have contributed to this knowledge base and hence there are infinitely many things to learn about.

Often times I have found myself uncomfortable with the lack of not knowing something and somehow I have found a lot of subjects interesting  literature, art, music
