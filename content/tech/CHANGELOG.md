    title: CHANGELOG
---

### 24.5.5
  1. I've put a rest on benchmarking SSL, I will post the benchmarks as of now.
  2. I have some progress on completing Probability, it will be helpful for modelling social issues.
  3. Started fly.io distributed systems challenge. [link](https://fly.io/dist-sys/1/)
  4. Started researching on AR, have been checking out meta reality labs and Spark Studio scripting documentation.

### 24.4.30
  1. Learning Probability is hard, preparing for the coming end semesters for this course to get a grip around its application.
  2. Been checking out Y combinator application, thinking of some ideas to execute and thinking of writing some open source proposals.

### 24.4.24
  1. Rewritten benchmarks to run on tls decryption only and remove other processes.
  2. Completed another unit of MIT 6.431x: Probability.

### 24.4.15
  1. Mostly been studying Probability since a couple of days. I had midterms of MIT 6.431x which I submitted yesterday.
  2. Working on analyzing ssl benchmarks for tls/crypto lib in go. Will explore to improve performance. 

### 24.4.12
  1. Read about SSL performance testing in go. Few resources helped me understand benchmarking in go and so I wrote simple benchmarks for SSL performance. 
  2. Read about go concurrency and it helped me handle/close resources in my benchmarks.
  3. Created 2 certs using RSA and ECDSA, and compared its performance.

 ### 24.4.11
  1. Doing some probability lately. Have been following 6.431x Probability course from MIT. There are many real world applications to this, which I am planning to read about after this course. Going back to maths, feels good.
  2. Reading about benchmarking ssl termination. Some useful articles - [https://www.haproxy.com/blog/benchmarking-ssl-performance](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/benchmarking-ssl-performance), [https://www.keycdn.com/blog/https-performance-overhead](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/https-performance-overhead), [https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NGINX-SSL-Performance.pdf](https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NGINX-SSL-Performance.pdf), [https://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html)
  3. Found another great resource for helping me benchmark is [https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20058](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20058). This issue has some good and useful insights.
